Project Title:
--------------
PoultryDetect: Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

Description:
------------
PoultryDetect is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images of chickens and detects common poultry diseases using a deep learning model (ResNet50 with Transfer Learning). This project aims to help poultry farmers identify diseases early and take preventive action.

Key Features:
-------------
✅ Upload an image of a chicken  
✅ AI model predicts one of the following conditions:
   - Healthy
   - Coccidiosis
   - Salmonella
   - New Castle Disease  
✅ Instant classification result on-screen  
✅ Simple and responsive web interface  
✅ Developed using Flask + TensorFlow + Keras + HTML/CSS
